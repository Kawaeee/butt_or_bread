# Corgi butt or loaf of bread? 

* We have seen a popular meme that tries to represent the similarity shared between animal and food such as **"Shiba Inu dog or toasted marshmallow?"** So, We would like to develop the deep learning model that removes the uncertainty of an image that could be like **a loaf of bread or corgi butt**. But for sure, We just do it for fun.

* We used PyTorch framework with GPU to develop our model using Google Colaboratory.

## Datasets
* Bread dataset was acquired from the combination of Google Open Images V5 + Google Images search
* Corgi dataset was acquired from the combination of ImageNet + Stanford Dogs + Google Images search

  **After that, we manually remove incorrect images and apply Perceptual Hashing to get rid of duplication images.**

  * Total images: 6385 images (randomly split using 80:10:10 ratios) with [dataset-split](https://github.com/muriloxyz/dataset-split)
  
    * **Bread**: 3710 images
    
      * Train: 2968 images
      * Valid: 371 images
      * Test: 371 images
    * **Corgi**: 2675 images
    
      * Train: 2140 images
      * Valid: 268 images
      * Test: 267 images
